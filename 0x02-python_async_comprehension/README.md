# Async Comprehension

This directory is aimed at learning how to use comprehension/generators for asyncio coroutines

## Objectives

* How to write an asynchronous generator
* How to use async comprehensions
* How to type-annotate generators

## Tasks

* [0-async_generator.py](0-async_generator.py) - Write a coroutine called async_generator that takes no arguments. The coroutine will loop 10 times, each time asynchronously wait 1 second, then yield a random number between 0 and 10. Use the random module
