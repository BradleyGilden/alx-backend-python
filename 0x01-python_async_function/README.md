# Python - ASYNCIO

This Directory has tasks on the subject of asynchronous/ concurrent programming in python

## Objectives

* async and await syntax
* How to execute an async program with asyncio
* How to run concurrent coroutines
* How to create asyncio tasks
* How to use the random module

## Tasks

* [0-basic_async_syntax.py](0-basic_async_syntax.py) - Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (max_delay, with a default value of 10) named wait_random that waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.
* [1-concurrent_coroutines.py](1-concurrent_coroutines.py) - Import wait_random from the previous python file that youâ€™ve written and write an async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments (in this order): n and max_delay. You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay
